Step by step puppet code and execution
---------------------------------------

Yum install puppet 
yum install puppet-3.6.1
cd /etc/puppet

if it is enterprise puppet version 
cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet

depending version you will site.pp
cd /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp

Manifests:
what is manifests?
Manifests contains resources and relationships

Resource?
All commands,services and configuration in linux operating system.


Resource syntax:

resource_type { "name":
attribute => value
}

example:

file { "/etc/test.txt":
content => " this is test file",
owner => root,
mode => 755,
}


Relations ships:
Puppet chaining using -> symbol
and metaparameters like require,before,subscribe and notify


Puppet class:

Puppet class is allow us to write re-usable code.



Simple manifest file:

java.pp
-------
node default {

include ::java( this java folder should be in the /etc/puppet/module)
}


using our owns resources:

java.pp
------
node default {

exec { "installing_java":
command => "yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
}
}


Puppet does not maintain the order if we write more than one resources 
we will write puppet chaining using ->


 
example:
This file should be in /etc/puppet/manifests/jenkins.pp

jenkins.pp
----------
node default {

exec { "wgetjenkins":
command => "wget jenkins.repo",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
}

exec { "rpmimportkey":
command => "rpt keyname"<
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:bin",
}


exec { "yuminstalljenkins":
command => "yum install jenkins",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
}

}


command to run the puppet:

pupet apply -v /etc/puppet/manifests/jenkins.pp


In this case, puppet may execute any resource if it executes "yuminstalljenkins" first puppet 
installation will be failed because it does not have rpm and tarball"


so we will give puppet chaining here to maintain the order of execution.

jenkins.pp
----------
node default {

exec { "wgetjenkins":
command => "wget jenkins.repo",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
} ->

exec { "rpmimportkey":
command => "rpt keyname"<
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:bin",
} -> 


exec { "yuminstalljenkins":
command => "yum install jenkins",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
}

}

if resources are more and to maintain dependency we will use metaparameters
require 

node default {

exec { "yuminstalljenkins":
command => "yum install jenkins",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
require => Exec["rpmimportkey"],
}

exec { "wgetjenkins":
command => "wget jenkins.repo",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin",
} 

exec { "rpmimportkey":
command => "rpt keyname",
path => "/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:bin",
require => Exec["wgetjenkins"]
} 

}


To validate the puppet files:
puppet parser validate puppetppfiles


Hiera.yaml
Hiera.yaml file is for loop up the data with in the puppet directories.

Hiera.yaml should be in /etc/puppet path

Hiera.yaml
---------
---
:backends:
  - yaml
:yaml:
  :datadir: "/etc/puppet/hieradata"   "this directory has role yaml files"
:hierarchy:
  - scm
